<!--Paragraph to show more details about the project listed in index.html file-->
<p> It is true that the use of a large number of antennas in transmission with spatial multiplexing allows for a higher gain in terms of bit rate; however this leads to greater energy consumption </br> and increased complexity at the receiver side.
    Using the Spatial Modulation technique, we are able to transmit data having multiple active antennas at the same time. This allows for the </br> problem of having to select the best combinations of activated antennas at the transmitter to reduce the effect of channel and antenna correlations.
    In our project we aim to design and </br> develop an algorithm for suitable antenna activation at the transmitter in massive MIMO with GSM. The method should be able to choose the best combination depending on the </br> channel information that minimizes the effects of channel and antenna correlation and to enhance the bit error rate performance.
    Several methods have been employed to serve the </br> purpose of improving the performance while maintaining a low Error Rate Probability. Our goal is to study those cases and exploit the method that best suites our </br> algorithm for Transmit Antenna Combination (TAC) selection, and then finding a proper mapping for the selected TACs that reduces the bit error probability.
